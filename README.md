# CPlusPlus-SumOfNaturalNumbers

This prompts the user to enter a number (n), then calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using a loop, and finally displays the result. 

For instance, if n were 20, the loop would progressively sum the natural numbers from 1 to 20, resulting in a sum of 210 as commented in the code shown.
